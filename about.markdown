EA Public Interest Technologists is all about creating technology that helps
in doing large amounts of good. We keep a list of projects and people on this
page so that we can show off the fantastic people and work that's being done by
our community.

Our current organizers are [Sam Nolan](/people/SamNolan.html) and [Evelyn Fitzgerald](/people/evelynciara.html).
